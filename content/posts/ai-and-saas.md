# Klarna, AI, and the Nature of Tech Transitions: Will AI Replace SaaS?

A handful of friends and colleagues recently shared the same headline: Klarna is supposedly trading in standard software tools for AI. The buzz focuses on how AI—especially generative AI—has automated key operations and replaced some enterprise tools. This raises an obvious question: is AI about to make SaaS obsolete?

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">We just had an epiphany: in a world of AI nothing will be as valuable as humans! <br><br>Ok you can laugh at us for realizing it so late, but we are going to kick off work to allow Klarna to become the best at offering a human to speak to!!!<br><br>So excited about this, more to come!</p>&mdash; Sebastian Siemiatkowski (@klarnaseb) <a href="https://twitter.com/klarnaseb/status/1890336313477361862?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 14, 2025</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

At first glance, it’s a tempting narrative. But if we look at how major technological changes have played out historically, we often see a more gradual shift. New solutions tend to layer on top of existing ones rather than instantly wiping them out.

## Looking Back to Look Ahead

When the client-server model arrived, people expected mainframes to vanish. They didn’t. Later, the rise of cloud computing was supposed to bury on-prem systems. Instead, many organizations adopted a hybrid approach. Even in consumer tech, mobile didn’t kill the PC. Time and again, “endings” turned out to be more like ongoing evolutions.

This pattern hints that AI likely won’t wipe out SaaS overnight. Instead, it will reshape the landscape, pushing businesses to rethink how they integrate and use software—but not necessarily tossing out everything that came before.

## Ecosystems and Gradual Evolution

A helpful way to see this is by thinking of SaaS platforms as deeply ingrained components of a company’s infrastructure. They store records, handle complex workflows, and comply with industry regulations. Simply replacing them is rarely practical, especially when there are significant compliance and operational details at stake.

Does that mean it’ll all stay the same? Not at all. AI can automate tasks across systems and potentially reduce the need for some specialized interfaces. It might even change how we think about user interaction—since an AI could handle data flow behind the scenes. But that doesn’t automatically remove the value of domain expertise, industry-specific workflows, or decades of refinements baked into many SaaS platforms.

## Where AI Challenges SaaS

AI is particularly good at orchestrating routine tasks and generating content. We can imagine an AI assistant that connects HR, finance, and CRM tools, reducing manual effort. In some cases, this orchestration could make standalone tools less visible, as certain interfaces get bypassed by AI-driven automation.

However, SaaS platforms are more than just interfaces. They’re shaped by deep knowledge of specific industries and business processes, along with robust security and compliance frameworks. While AI can learn patterns, it usually doesn’t show up on day one fully equipped with the legal, regulatory, and domain know-how that SaaS vendors have built over years.

## The Hybrid Future

Rather than a scenario where AI simply “replaces” SaaS, it seems more likely the two will converge. Many SaaS platforms are already integrating AI to offer improved analytics, suggestions, and automated workflows. Meanwhile, AI systems will continue to rely on SaaS data stores, APIs, and built-in logic to carry out complex tasks.

This approach benefits everyone. AI can streamline operations, but it remains anchored in the proven reliability of SaaS. Meanwhile, SaaS platforms that embrace AI can deliver more automated, data-driven capabilities to their customers.

## Lessons from the Past (and Present)

We’ve seen again and again that new technologies rarely sweep away older ones in one dramatic move. Mainframes coexist with client-server systems, on-prem coexists with cloud, and so on. This historical pattern suggests AI and SaaS will likely coexist, shape each other, and encourage both innovation and adaptation in the process.

Yes, there will be disruption. Vendors with shallow offerings might get squeezed out if an AI system can reproduce their core features. But for those with deep industry expertise and robust compliance, AI is more of a partner than a threat.

## A Shared Path Forward

Ultimately, the question of AI “replacing” SaaS might be the wrong frame. More often than not, we’re seeing organizations blend new technologies with existing ones to create better outcomes. AI will change how software is built and used, but it won’t erase the systems of record or domain-specific applications that businesses depend on. Instead, it can make these platforms smarter and more valuable—turning the future into a story of collaboration rather than replacement.

We’ve watched similar transformations before. Each wave of innovation pushes companies to modernize, yet they rarely discard everything that came before. AI may accelerate this process, but it’s unlikely to lead to a wholesale abandonment of SaaS. Instead, expect a dynamic mix of both, reflecting tech’s usual pattern: big changes, but rarely a complete reset.
